        Modern web design is more than just looks — it's about how users experience and interact with your content. Here’s how to blend creativity with usability.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Embrace White Space</h3>
      <p>
        Don't clutter your page. White space gives your content room to breathe and allows users to focus. It also improves readability and helps guide the user's eye.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Use a Visual Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>
        Visual hierarchy means placing the most important elements first — large headings, contrasting buttons, and highlighted text direct attention. This boosts user engagement.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Consistent Color and Typography</h3>
      <p>
        Stick to a color palette and no more than 2-3 font styles. This consistency keeps your brand recognizable and visually clean, avoiding confusion or distraction.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Incorporate User-Centered Design</h3>
      <p>
        Great design is not just pretty — it solves a problem. Always ask, “What does the user need here?” Prioritize usability and accessibility at every step.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Stay Inspired and Keep Experimenting</h3>
      <p>
        Creativity grows with exposure. Browse design galleries, follow UI trends, and sketch ideas. Try new layouts or animations to refresh your creativity.
      </p>

      <p class="closing-text">
        In the end, design is a balance of aesthetics, functionality, and user empathy. Keep experimenting and learning, and your creativity will naturally grow.
